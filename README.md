A recommendation system provides suggestions to the users through a filtering process that is based on user preferences and browsing history. The information about the user is taken as an input. The information is taken from the input that is in the form of browsing data. This information reflects the prior usage of the product as well as the assigned ratings. A recommendation system is a platform that provides its users with various contents based on their preferences and likings. A recommendation system takes the information about the user as an input.

The use of several online websites such Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, YouTube Music, Goodreads has phenomenally increased over the last decade with more titles and entertainment industry focusing their attention in diverting funds towards acquiring this web space as a source of income. As India dawns into a new age of technological breakthroughs and internet penetration rising at higher than 15% per year, It is of utmost importance that there shall be an understanding as well as use of various recommendation engines to make sure the user sees what they like and often make the job of suggestion an automated process based on cleverly defined algorithms.
